Project Description/Outline

We will examine the zip codes containing the countryâ€™s ten most expensive universities in order to examine if proximity to these schools correlates to the levels of income disparity in those areas. We will do this by comparing number of households in the area below the national poverty level to the number of households making $200k or greater. We will then compare this to the income disparity levels in ten randomly selected zip codes.

Research Questions to Answer

1. What are the areas with the greatest levels of disparity?
2. What areas have the greatest equality?
3. Do education levels differ between University adjacent and non-adjacent areas?
